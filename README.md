# Boostrap Bot

An early stage Rocket League bot built with Go and optional ML (Python training → ONNX → Go inference). Control and integration are in Go; ML training lives in `ml/`.

- **Build and run on Windows with RLBot GUI:** see [docs/build-windows.md](docs/build-windows.md).
- **Wiring Go ↔ ML (obs, action, ONNX):** see [in progress](tbd).
